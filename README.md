# MultiClipBoard (Name needed)
> Multiple numbered clipboards to eliminate the need for scratch tabs

## How to use:
* **Controls**:
  * The default *CTRL+C* still works.
  * Use *CTRL+C* plus any number key  (0-9, normal or numpad) to copy anything to a numbered clipboard
  * Use *CTRL+V* plus any number key  (0-9, normal or numpad) to paste content from a numbered clipboard
* **Scripts:**
   * ```end.bat``` kills the running program.
   * ```install.bat``` copies the program to the autostart folder.
   * ```uninstall.bat``` removes the program from the autostart folder.

## Notes:
This is a proof of concept. Sometimes it doesn't detect keypresses right, I am working on it.

Due to the technology this program uses, some Antivirus programs may detect it as malware.

For best results, you may press *CTRL* and any number key and then add the *C*, *X*, or *V* key.

Also, this program breaks any program using *CTRL+number key* hotkeys. For example, Firefox' tab shortcuts won't be available.
